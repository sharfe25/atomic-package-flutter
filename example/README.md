# Atomic Flutter Package Example

This example demonstrates the usage of the Atomic Flutter Package, showcasing various components categorized by Atomic Design principles.

## Overview

Atomic design is a methodology for creating design systems by breaking UI elements into fundamental components. This example organizes components into five levels:

- **Atoms**: Basic UI elements.
- **Molecules**: Groups of atoms functioning together.
- **Organisms**: Compositions of molecules that form distinct sections of an interface.
- **Templates**: Complete layouts or pages.
- **Pages**: Specific instances of templates, representing full user interfaces.

## Components

### Atoms Page
Displays basic UI elements like `SkeletonWidget`, `IconButtonWidget`, and `ChipWidget`.

### Molecules Page
Shows groups of atoms working together, including `DetailCard` and `ChipsCarousel`.

### Organism Page
Features higher-level components composed of molecules and atoms, such as `CardsGrid`, `CustomAppBar`, and `LoginForm`.

### Templates Page
Demonstrates complete layouts or templates like `DashboardTemplate`, showcasing structured UI with navigation elements.

### Pages Page
Represents specific instances of templates, such as `LoginPage`, showing full-fledged user interfaces.
